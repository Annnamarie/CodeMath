## Summary

BMICalculator is an android app that gets inout from the user for their weight and height (ft and inches) and calculates their BMI.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: üìèüß†üí™

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

## Notes

- First app to fully code from scratch with Kotlin
- Utilize interactivie view - will not calculate the BMI until the calculate button is clicked
- Learned how to oull the values from the EditText
- I was originally going to use a spinner but had a lot of issues with and my app kept crashing. I will continue to explore the spinner button. I did learn how to use it and add values through the string.xml
